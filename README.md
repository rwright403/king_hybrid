### Note: mostly broken code! do not use right now lol --> see DEV LRE Progress Update... for the most recent documentation and explaination for where this program is rn

### Rocket Engine Simulation ðŸš€

This program was designed to be a framework for a user to combine and use different models to simulate a rocket engine.

## RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
This file takes input in the form of a python module file. 

In the directory this file is in:  #python3 -m src <filename of a desired python module file without the .py>

The inputs folder contains the input files where the user can update the inputs the program uses.

the analysis_mode list is used to select the types of models used by the program.

[TODO: DOCUMENT MODELS IN EACH FILE]

source venv/bin/activate


## Context:
This is part of my personal rocket engine design project. It started as a continuation of Ben Klammer's work [1]
He does some really cool things like optimization that this program does not do. 
I would recommend checking his thesis and program out. His work taught me a good amount of what I know about propulsion

I decided to make this program over already built software packages because my small scale engine's design loads are very dependent on the self-pressurized
feed system, and I want to build design tools that will help me understand performance when I build my engine.

Through working with different system models, the program has evolved into a relatively modular framework where the user can easily add new models.

I have definitely learned a lot through making this program. Even when the program is broken, its cool to see how the errors propagate through the program. I have read about vehicle failures where the failure of a component causes several effects that propagate through the system, and I definitely see that when I have extraneous inputs.

I got some of the liquid stuff to work and accidentally broke the hybrid models. I likely won't fix the hybrid stuff for a while.

#Use at your own risk lol, I am still developing and debugging this program. When things are more stable I will do better at documentation
