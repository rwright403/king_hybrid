### Rocket Engine Simulation ðŸš€

## RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

In the directory this file is in:  #python3 -m src <filename without the .py>

The inputs folder contains files where the user can update the inputs the program uses.

the analysis_mode vector selects the types of models used by the program.
[TODO: DOCUMENT MODELS IN EACH FILE]



## Context:
A continuation of Ben Klammer's work. All the hybrid stuff in this program is ripped from of it:
https://github.com/UVicRocketry/HybridModeling
He does some really cool things like optimization that this program does not do. 
I would recommend checking his thesis and program out. His work taught me a good amount of what I know about propulsion

I made this progam to help with rocket engine design. I decided to make this over alternatives like
already built software packages alternatives because I enjoy programming and I value having the control
of creating my own models and the understanding it brings me. I think it is important to have a good amount
of understanding and control because of how finicky nitrous oxide is.

Maybe this isn't the most efficient choice though. I have definitely learned a lot through making it though. Even when the program is broken, its cool to see how the errors propagate through the program. I have read about vehicle failures where the failure of a component causes several effects that propagate through the system, and I definitely see that when I have extraneous inputs.

This program was designed to be a framework for a user to combine and use different models to simulate a rocket engine.

I got some of the liquid stuff to work and by doing that broke the hybrid models. I am no longer interested in hybrids so I likely won't fix the hybrid stuff.

###Use at your own risk lol, I am still developing this program
